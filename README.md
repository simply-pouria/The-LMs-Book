# The-LMs-Book
This repository contains my study notes, code implementations, and experiments while reading The Hundred-Page Language Models Book. It includes key takeaways, summaries, and hands-on coding exercises covering topics such as transformers, tokenization, training techniques, and practical applications of LLMs.
